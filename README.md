# My first page

## Description 

 This project will be my portfolio when I polish within the next 3 months. 

## Installation

To run this application you need a browser. 
Any browser will work for you but as a web developer, I recommend you to use google chrome.  


## Usage 

Home page is just a little bit of information about me and who I am. In the nav bar you will see my name and it contains a link which will take you to my Instagram page where you add me as your friend. Also, nav bar contains Home page where you are right now. But if you will click Portfolio later you will find all my works and I promise it will be amazing. Next, there is contact me where if you will fill in a short form you can reach me. 


## Credits

I did this project by myself using a little bit of google.com and some help from Wilson.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Sory for short readme file but it is a small project and there is nothing much to talk about it.
