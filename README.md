# Day planner 

## Description 

This application is a planner to help schedule out your workday. It allows you to enter and save events based on when they are scheduled. The planner utilizes Moments.js to display if the hour is in the past, present, or future, and is color-coded accordingly.

The JavaScript and jQuery used to create this app was written by me, DJ Hersh. The HTML and CSS were provided by the UCLA Extension Full-Stack Web-Development Coding Bootcamp and instructor Bryan Swarthout. I added some styling elements, such as a linear-gradient for the background and box-shadows around the time-blocks.

I utilized local storage to allow the user to save events even after they navigate away from the page.

## Installation

To run this application you need a browser. Any browser will work for you but as a web developer, I recommend you to use google chrome.

## Usage

When you get to the page, you will see the current date displayed at the top, and a block to add scheduled events for each hour of the workday. To add an event, simply click on the box in the appropriate hour block, enter your event, and click the save button. Using Moments.js, the planner will be color-coded based on if the hour of the block has past, is current, or is in the future.
